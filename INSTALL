Installation instructions
-------------------------

The latest version of jail is available from:
<http://www.wiw.org/~ams/jail/>, or from
<http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/daemons/>.

To compile and install jail:

$ gzip -dc jail-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ su root
# make install

By default, binaries are installed into /usr/sbin, and the configuration
files are installed in /etc.

You can also do:

# make DESTDIR=/usr/local CONFDIR=/usr/local/etc install

to install to a nonstandard location. 

icmplog  and  tcplog are typically started at bootup from the init scripts,
for example the rc.local file. The tcplog(8) and  icmplog(8)  manual  pages
describe  the  relevant  options,  and  the  configuration file formats are
detailed in tcplog.conf(5) and icmplog.conf(5).

Read the README file for more information.
