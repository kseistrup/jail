README for jail
---------------

jail  (Just  Another IP Logger) consists of two small programs (icmplog and
tcplog) which run in the background, logging the reception of ICMP and  TCP
packets  to  the  system  log. The level  at  which any packet is logged is
completely configurable. This is a useful network monitoring tool, and  can
help to  detect attempted denials of service.

icmplog  and  tcplog  can either ignore any packet, or log it at any of the
syslog levels (as defined in <syslog.h>). The  log  level  is  configurable
depending  on  the ICMP type (icmplog) or the port on which a connection is
requested (tcplog). The default facility (LOG_DAEMON) for logging  messages
can also be changed in the configurations files.

The  level  at  which  a given type of packet is logged is specified in the
configuration files (/etc/icmplog.conf  and  /etc/tcplog.conf  by  default,
which  can be overriden with the  --file  option).  You  can  also  specify
a default level, which matches packets that have an unknown or unconfigured
type.  See  the  example  configurations included  and  the  icmplog(8) and
tcplog(8) manual pages for more information.

Log entries contain the source and type (icmplog) or destination port
(tcplog) of the received packet. If a packet is of an unknown type, its
numeric  value  is  logged  instead  of its name. The source is logged
either as a hostname or as an IP address (see the -n option). Typical
entries look like:

Jun 16 17:47:30 lustre icmplog: started
Jun 16 17:47:31 lustre tcplog: started
Jun 16 18:54:14 lustre icmplog: time exceeded from sunsite.unc.edu
Jun 16 18:56:14 lustre tcplog: port 1039 request from ftp.cs.umn.edu
Jun 16 19:47:24 lustre icmplog: destination unreachable from 209.39.121.4

The  INSTALL  file  contains  detailed  installation instructions. Read the
icmplog(8), icmplog.conf(5), tcplog(8) and tcplog.conf(5) manual pages, and
the   example    configuration    files  (icmplog.conf and tcplog.conf) for
more information on setting up and using jail.

jail   was   originally  based  on the iplogger package, but offers greater
configurability and better options.  It  bears  very  little resemblance to
the original program now.
