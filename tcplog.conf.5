given ports should be logged.

Log levels for packets are specified using the
.B `type [level]'
rule described below.

A default log level can be specified with the
.B level
keyword, which is used for port numbers
which have not been explicitly assigned a level in the configuration.

The default syslog facility can be overriden with the
.B facility
keyword.
configuration.

The `except' keyword can be used to specify a list of hosts from which
connections should be ignored.

Lines beginning with `#' (shell-style comments) and blank lines in the
configuration file are ignored.

An example configuration is included with the source distribution and is
installed by default into
.I /etc/tcplog.conf

.IP "except [host], [host], [host]"
Specify a list of hosts to ignore connection requests from. The list can be
comma or whitespace separated, and may contain fragments like `192.168.'

the source host, otherwise the comparison is made with the resolved
hostname.

WARNING, NOTICE, INFO and DEBUG.
.IP "facility [facility]"
Specify the default logging facility. The facility can be any one of USER,

.IP "[service] [level]"
This is a generic rule which specifies the level at which connections to a
certain port are logged. The service can either be a numeric port number,
or a service name (as specified in
.I /etc/services
). The level, as above, is a
