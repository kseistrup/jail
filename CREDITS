Acknowledgements
----------------

I would like to thank all the people who have helped me with bug-reports,
suggestions, and patches during the development of this program. If I have
neglected to mention your contribution here, please drop me a line and I'll
correct this oversight.

In alphabetical order:

- Alexey Kuznetsov and Andi Kleen contributed ICMP_FILTER code for 2.1.x
  kernels.
- Arnt Gulbrandsen suggested the magic tree which made tcplog possible, and
  helped in numerous other ways.
- Bret Martin helped with the initial configuration code.
- David Rocher sent me patches to support glibc 2.
- Horst Knobloch sent me patches to support installation to nonstandard
  locations.
- Jay Kominek maintains the Debian package of jail.
- Jeffrey Sean Connell pointed out that i was doing malloc(strlen(name))
  (instead of malloc(strlen(name+1)) - I have no idea how this escaped
  for so long.
- John Hudson named this package jail, made me implement host exclusion,
  and whines a lot.
- Lars Kellogg-Stedman sent me signal handling patches which will
  eventually be integrated into jail.
- The Linux netdev mailing list offered some valuable help (Alan Cox,
  Alexey Kuznetsov and Andi Kleen in particular).
- Nicolai Langfeldt convinced me that I am not in Kansas, and pointed me to
  the NFR (Network Flight Recorder).
- unSlider helped with testing and gave me lots of ideas.

I would also like to thank the author of iplogger, whose program I initially
got the idea and some code for jail from.
