.SH NAME
icmplog.conf \- configuration file for icmplog(8).

.SH SYNOPSIS
.I /etc/icmplog.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B icmplog(8)
configuration file is used to specify the level at which ICMP packets of
a given type should be logged.

Log levels for packets are specified using the
.B `type [level]'
rule described below.

A default log level can be specified with the
.B level
keyword, which is used for packet types
which have not been explicitly assigned a level in the configuration.

The default syslog facility can be overriden with the
.B facility
keyword.

The `except' keyword can be used to specify a list of hosts from which
connections should be ignored.

Lines beginning with `#' (shell-style comments) and blank lines in the
configuration file are ignored.

An example configuration is included with the source distribution and is
installed by default into
.I /etc/icmplog.conf

.SH KEYWORDS
.IP "except [host], [host], [host]"
Specify a list of hosts to ignore connection requests from. The list can be
comma or whitespace separated, and may contain fragments like `192.168.'
and `.foo.com'. If the fragment is numeric, it is compared with the IP of
the source host, otherwise the comparison is made with the resolved
hostname.
.IP "level [level]"
Specify the default logging level. The level  can be any one of IGNORE,
ERR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO and DEBUG.
.IP "facility [facility]"
Specify the default logging facility. The facility can be any one of USER,
DAEMON and LOCAL0-7.
.IP "[type] [level]"
This is a generic rule which specifies the level at which packets of a
certain type are logged. The type can either be numeric, or one of the
keywords `echoreply', `destunreach', `quench', `redirect', `echo',
`timeout', `paramprob', `timereq', `timerep', `inforeq' or `inforep'.
The level, as above, is a
.I syslog.h
symbolic constant.
